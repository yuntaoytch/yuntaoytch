### 🤖 - Azure Functions Updates Twitterbot

I've built the *Azure Functions Updates Twitterbot* ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/az_func_updates), [GitHub](https://github.com/marcduiker/az-func-updates)). It's been tweeting about new releases related to dozens of Azure Functions GitHub repositories since early 2019.

There are plans for extending this bot, see the [issues](https://github.com/marcduiker/az-func-updates/issues).
